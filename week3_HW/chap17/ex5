ex 5 page 454. a Struct is defined

struct{
    union{
        char a, b;
	int c;
    } d;
    int e[5];
}

f, *p = &f;   // f = instance of struct, p = pointer to struct


Which of the following statements are legal?

a) p->b = ' '; This is not a valid way to assign a value to char b. you need to access it through variable d, so it should be p->d.b
b) p->e[3] = 10; This is legal, the arrow symbol linmks to the array 3, and defenrences address at index 3.
c) (*p).d.a = '*'; This is legal, it is deferencing the pointer, p and then accessing the value at a. If the parenthesis were not around the variable p, the dots would take precedence and this would not be valid
d) p->d->c = 20; This is not legal, d is not a pointer, so arrow notation will not work. The correct way to assign the value is p->d.c
