if I is a variable, and p points to i, which of the following expressions are aliases for i?

a) *p = Alias
b) &p = Not Alias, will return address of p
c) *&p = Not Alias, p is a pointer, this will return the address of the pointer 
d) &*p = Not Alias, this will return the address if the value pointed to by p
e) *i = Not Alias, i dont think a variable can be dereferenced in this way
f) &i = Not Alias, this will return the address of i
g) *&i = Alias, this is a dereference of the address of variable i
h) &*i = Not Alias, this is an error and wont compile
